# Meme-Machine
A little project I made for my CS111 class

TO RUN:
1. install Python 3, latest version is preferable
2. install the Pillow library using easy_install.exe or pip
3. unzip files from zip archive
4. ensure images folder, impact.ttf, and Python file are all located in the same folder
5. double click on the Python file to run

HOW TO USE:
* The program will output several options to the console, use the number code next to each option to choose one.
* To input values into the program, type in the console and press ENTER
* When an image is generated, the program will restart itself to be used again.

ADD A NEW IMAGE:
* Put a PNG image with a bit depth of 24 or lower in the images folder.
* When starting the program, the new image will be detected.
